ggplot2 plots made easy for Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)
------------------------------------------------------------------

`ggplot.acm` provides an easy way of creating a `ggplot2`-style plot for a multiple correspondence analysis run with the `FactoMineR` package (this is important, as other packages/functions may product objects with a different internal structure). Multiple options are provided, which should adress the most common uses in social sciences. The `autoplot.MCA` function extends the `autoplot` generic function, and returns a `ggplot2` object, which can then be further modified.
